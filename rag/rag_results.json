The `tc` matrix is used to store the minimum cost of reaching each position. The function initializes the first row and column of `tc`, then fills in the rest of the matrix by considering the minimum cost of reaching the current position from the top, left, or diagonally above-left positions, and adding the cost of the current cell. Finally, it returns the minimum cost of reaching the target position (m, n).",
